Scheduler
---------

	Scheduler is a web time management application. It can calculate and 
display hourly schedule on requested time period with entered tasks. Also
it helps count free time and planning time, shows when some task can be
finished with a given time budget.

	This is studying project. The main purpose of this application is to 
demonstrate basic understanding Java-based and related technologies like: 
HTML, JSP, Servlets, Spring MVC, Spring Secure (for Spring MVC only), JPA, 
Hibernate, SQL, Maven and Git. Not to consider this project like finished,
not all functionality is finished and application has some bugs for now.
I will be grateful to get any warnings, criticism or advices about 
application on my email yvalera85@gmail.com

	The application requires servlet container (tested on Tomcat 8.0) and 
relation database to launch. Now it configured to work with MySql at 
database "scheduler". Table "security" must be created manually. Warning!
Hibernate configured to automatically creation or structure changing all 
the other tables if it is necessary.
